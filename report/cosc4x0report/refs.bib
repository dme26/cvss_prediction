    abstract = {The Common Vulnerability Scoring System is at the core of
                vulnerability management for systems of private corporations to
                highly classified government networks, allowing organizations to
                prioritize remediation in descending order of risk. With a lack
                of justification for its underlying formula, inconsistencies in
                its specification document, and no correlation to exploited
                vulnerabilities in the wild, it is unable to provide a meaningful
                metric for describing a vulnerability’s severity, let alone risk.
                As it stands, this standard compromises the security of America’s
                most sensitive information systems.},
