Like accept reject sampling we are going to propose a candidate

The mean of this distribution will be from the previous sample

Go look at the previous sample, centre distribution there at X_t sample the next
candidate from that distribution

Propose a candidate accept via some probability A(x_t -> x_t+1)

A(a->b) = f(b) g(a|b)
------    --- x ---
A(b->a)   f(a) g(b|a)
           ^     ^
          rf    rg
How to find A? A(a->b) = Min(1, rfrg)

If not accepted, dont previous

Inch towards areas of highest probability

Still able to sample the tails
