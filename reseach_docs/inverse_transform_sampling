Can generate common distribution easily.

How?

Uniform numbers 0, 1

Want to generate an exponential lambda distribution

PDF = probability lambda function

CDF = Cumulative density function 
For any x you put in, probability that is x or less
So what is the probability of x or less from this distribution

Apply a transform to fit the CDF and PDF

CDF = FxF(x) = { 1-e^lambda*x}, x >= 0
               { o, x < 0 

T(U) = X want to solve for T

Fx(x) = P(X <= x) = So what is the probability of x or less from this distribution
=  P(T(U) <= x) We want inverse so,
=  P(U <= T^-1(x)) = T^-1(x)

SO CDF = T^-1(x) = FxF(x)


For uniform distribution this will be the same as the probablity itself

Probability of x being less than 0.75 is 0.75

So to find the inverse, find the inverse of the CDF, run the distribution through that

Doable as long as you can invert the CDF
