Monte Carlo

Generation of random numbers

Markov chains also end up as a random walk?

Burn in period discards initial values before it stabilises

Uses the markov chain to make the sampling depend on the state of the
previous thing

How?

Some initial sample

Use previous sample to make the next sample

How can we encode the transition states as we don't have them

We need the steady state 

Engineer a markov chain which has a stationary distribution as the probability
distribution we want we are trying to fit
