Sampling distribution, parameter itself considered fixed

parameters are considered a distribution

Prior = prior belief

Use a beta or uniform distribution to set prior, change it based on some hypothesis

Likelihood is based on the experimental result

Prior is important as it will colour the output, but if the data is strong enough
it will outweigh the prior. 

Weak prior needs more data

Previous distribution from a previous study can serve as the prior for the next one
