Real world example

Every day it can be one of two states, Sunny or cloudy
The days are only reliant on the previous day and the weather is fully dependent on these probabilities

Takes three components

State space
    {Sunny, cloudy}

Markov Assumption
    State only depends on the previous state
    P(W_t | W_t-1, W_t-2) == P(W_t|W_t-1)

Transition Matrix
       Sunny, Cloudy
Sunny    0.3   0.7
Cloudy   0.5   0.5


What is the steady state?

If the values converge, we have got a distribution, if given enough iterations the probabilities will stabilise

Pi is used as the indicator as the steady state
