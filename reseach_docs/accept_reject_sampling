Inverse transform requires CDF and for the CDF being inversed


Common that we have the numerator for the population distribution function, but hard to get the NC

P(s) = f(s)/NC
NC = normalized constant
    -> Defined by the integral from -inf to +inf of the PDF

Method
    Sample from something similar to P(s), the more similar, the more efficient

    The function we choose must always be above f(x)

    Sample g(s)
        accept or reject based on f(s)/M*g(s) probability of acceptence


Stop after some stopping condition. These samples should end up being from p(s)

We want to prove that: 
    Show that the density of those samples are p(s)

f(x)/g(x) Ratio between the similar distribution, so high chance to be samples in target distribution

Common issue is the choice of g(s), multiplying the distribution so that the f(s)/g(s) can be interpreted as a 
probability
