Do a similar analysis of CVSS 4.0 to see if it fixes some of these issues

@Tlopasha you can find CISA KEV and InTheWild API from a Google search. If you're digging into prioritization, I would
recommend you have a look at EPSS, from first.org (responsible for the CVSS specification BTW): first.org/epss Like
everything statistical related, read it cover to cover, with the fine prints. first.org/epss/api Last, have a look at
SSVC: cisa.gov/stakeholder-specific-vulnerability-categorization-ssvc github.com/CERTCC/SSVC

CVSS descriptions are very short
